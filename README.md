# go-simple-service

A simple microservice with Golang, Mainly done while learning Golang

- [x] CRUD APIs
  - [x] List
  - [x] Get
  - [x] Update
  - [x] Create
  - [x] Delete

# TODO - Order is not pririty:

- Connect to DB (PostgreSQL).
- Dockerfile and Docker compose.
- Better setup repository and improve documenation.
- Add more unit tests.
- Add some authentication (proably some JWT).
- Add some permissions for calling APIs.
- Refactor code and make more order.

Special thanks to [Nic Jackson](https://www.youtube.com/c/NicJackson) and for his greate tutorial on Go and Microservices.
